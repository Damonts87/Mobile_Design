            <h2>Whooooo</h2>
                <p>Just trying to make up gibberish to put in here because its more fun that using lorum ipsum. So I gotta write a lot to make a decent sized paragraph. I got a lot of homework done today. I finished my calculus homework last night which was great. The actual homework sucked though. I barely know anything thats going on in that class. I got a test this weekend that I am not ready for. Hopefully I can study with Sammy. Or Sammi. Or Sammie. I don't know how to spell her name. Her real name is Samantha but goes by Sammy or Sammi or Sammie. I've been talking to her while walking to and from class and I think shes really pretty. I'm going to try to get her number tonight if I can work up the confidence. I don't know why I'm telling this to my website. I don't know if anyone will actually read this whole thing. If you do then I am sorry. I'll write some more interesting stuff in the next paragraph. </p><br>
            <h2>Wowza</h2>
                <p>More story time. Sunday night I got back from Canyoneering down in White Canyon. It's down in Bears Ears, between Blanding and Moab. It was quite fun. A lot hotter than we expected it to be. Which was kind of nice. It was fun to get to try a new canyon. We did Fry Canyon. It was fun. Not my favorite canyon we've done. I like the tighter slot canyons better. This canyon was wider. But it had a ton of water. Big swims. Which was crazy for being in the desert in southern Utah in September. But it was a fun experience. The long swim was probaly 300 feet long. It had a few stretches where I couldn't touch the bottom, so over 6 feet deep. It was crazy. But it only had one rappel which was a little disappointing. I sat in a little hole for over 2 hours helping people down the rappel and into the swim. I got to scout it them my coworker got to scout the swim. Then at the end we screwed up and left the knot in the rope so my other coworker had to do a pick off, meaning climb back up the rope with a sling and grigri, to get the rope unstuck before we could do the swim and hike out of the canyon.</p><br>
